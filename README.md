This was an attempt to make a Minecraft server publicly accessible using Docker, socat, Node.js, and probably sheer willpower.

It didn't work.

But maybe... it will for you?

## What It Was *Supposed* To Do

- Forward TCP traffic to a Minecraft server running on a locked-down home network. [Thanks a lot, *HersheyTel*.]
- Bypass router admin password shenanigans.
- Become a legend.

## What It Actually Did

- Installed `socat` for tunnel sorcery.
- Set up a Node.js TCP pipe to nowhere.
- Absolutely imploded in practice.
- Caused emotional damage.

## Why It's Still Here

Because archiving your failures is character development.

Feel free to fork it, fix it, or just stare at it like a digital campfire of sadness.

## License

None. Take it. Burn it. Make it worse.
